This approach promotes transparent and effective communication throughout the design, construction, and building management process.",
    "list-title3": "IDS:",
    "list-description3": "IDS (Information Delivery Specification) format is a set of standardized specifications that defines data and process requirements for building information modeling (BIM). It provides a structured framework for creating, managing, and exchanging BIM data throughout the lifecycle of a construction project. By using the IDS format, stakeholders can agree on the information required for each phase of the project, ensuring efficient collaboration and seamless data integration across different disciplines and software systems.",
    "image-description": "Validation engine, your quality assurance (BuildingSMART)",
    "paragraph-title1": "BIM Use Cases and BIM Data",
    "paragraph-description1": "Data exchange is one of the fundamental pillars of BIM, offering a multitude of use cases in the construction industry. Through the collaborative design process, teams can exchange 3D models and information to visualize and analyze different phases of a project. During planning and construction, data exchange allows for the exchange of valuable information such as element characteristics, their spatial relationships and positions, costs, deadlines, information specific to dimensions, guarantees, and element functions. There is no limit, and any information useful to a use case can be included in digital models. After project delivery, BIM data continues to be valuable for facility management, preventive maintenance, and decision-making based on historical data. In summary, BIM data exchange enables transparent collaboration throughout the lifecycle of a construction project, improving efficiency, quality, and building sustainability.",
    "paragraph-title2": "How IDS Works",
    "paragraph-description2": "According to BuildingSMART, an Information Delivery Specification (IDS) is presented as a machine-interpretable document that establishes information exchange conditions in a model-based context. It defines how objects, classifications, properties, as well as values and units should be delivered and shared. This specification represents the standard to follow to define the required level of information. It ensures the validation of IFC for the client, the modeler, and the software tools used for (automated) analyses. It is a crucial element that can serve as a contract to guarantee the provision of correct information. Additionally, it offers the possibility to create specific and localized requirements tailored to the different use cases encountered in your projects and asset portfolio. In summary, IDS represents the solution to establish predictable and reliable data exchange workflows.",
    "paragraph-title3": "BIM Data Quality",
    "paragraph-description3": "With BIM, the amount of information becomes significant, and this data must be usable by other project stakeholders. We can liken this process to exchanging databases, and by making this analogy, we quickly realize the importance of having a well-established data structure. For this reason, it is important to implement collaboration methods that allow defining requirements, transmitting these requirements understandably, verifying the data to be transmitted or received, and maintaining this process over time. Today, establishing a data quality management process becomes a major challenge in our BIM projects. Furthermore, BIM applications evolve as companies deepen their adoption of this technology, leading to a significant increase in the volume of information to manage.",
